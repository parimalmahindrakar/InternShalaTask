## Technology used for this problem
To solve this problem, I have used Django web framework. It was very interesting problem.

## How I solved it ?
  
  First, I created the login and signup pages.Next, for signup and password reset I have also added validations for password. Then, I categorized two groups ,
  the first group will be the admina and second group will be general. If the admin person is watching it then he should see all the responses given by general
  users. If user is from general category then he should give the post about proficiency in programming tools/languages. As soon as user submits his post , that 
  post will be added into the database, and it will be added dynamically into the admin category.

## how would I improve this app ?

  To improve this app we can also create Dango REST api so that this app will communicate to every programming language. We can also give an option to user that
  whether he/she wants to share his post to some via email. We may create this application as like as blogging site also.
